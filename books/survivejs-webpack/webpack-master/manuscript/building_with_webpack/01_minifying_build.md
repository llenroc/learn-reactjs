# Minifying the Build

So far we haven't given thought to our build output and no doubt it's going to be a little chunky, especially as we include React in it. We can apply a variety of techniques to bring down the size of it. We can also leverage client level caching and load certain assets lazily. I'll discuss the latter topic in the *Understanding Chunks* chapter later on.

The first of these techniques is known as minification. It is a process where code is simplified without losing any meaning that matters to the interpreter. As a result your code will most likely look quite jumbled and it will be hard to read. But that's the point.

When certain aggressive minification techniques are applied, sometimes even the meaning of the resulting code may change. This is the reason why certain frameworks apply certain countermeasures against excessive minification. You can see this in Angular 1 definitions for example.

T> Even if we minify our build, we can still generate sourcemaps through the `devtool` option we discussed earlier. This will give us better means to debug even production code.

## Generating a Baseline Build

To get started, we should generate a baseline build so we have something to optimize. Given our project is so small, there isn't much to optimize yet. We could bring a heavy dependency like React to get something to slim up. Install React first:

```bash
npm i react --save
```

We also need to make our project depend on it:

**app/index.js**

```
leanpub-start-insert
require('react');
leanpub-end-insert

...
```

Now that we have something to optimize, execute `npm run build`. You should end up with something like this:

```bash
[webpack-validator] Config is valid.
Hash: dde0419cac0674732a83
Version: webpack 1.13.0
Time: 1730ms
     Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    app.js     133 kB       0  [emitted]  app
app.js.map     157 kB       0  [emitted]  app
index.html  157 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] ./app/index.js 123 bytes {0} [built]
  [37] ./app/component.js 136 bytes {0} [built]
    + 36 hidden modules
Child html-webpack-plugin for "index.html":
        + 3 hidden modules
```

133 kB is a lot! Minification should bring down the size a lot.

## Minifying the Code

Minification will convert our code into a smaller format without losing any meaning. Usually this means some amount of rewriting code through predefined transformations. Sometimes, this can break code as it can rewrite pieces of code you inadvertently depend upon.

The easiest way to enable minification is to call `webpack -p` (`-p` as in `production`). Alternatively, we can use a plugin directly as this provides us more control. By default Uglify will output a lot of warnings and they don't provide value in this case, we'll be disabling them.

As earlier, we can define a little function for this purpose and then point to it from our main configuration. Here's the basic idea:

**lib/parts.js**

```javascript
...

leanpub-start-insert
exports.minify = function() {
  return {
    plugins: [
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
        compress: {
          warnings: false
        }
      })
    ]
  };
}
leanpub-end-insert
```

Now we can hook it up with our configuration like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

// Detect how npm is run and branch based on that
switch(process.env.npm_lifecycle_event) {
  case 'build':
    config = merge(
      common,
leanpub-start-insert
      parts.minify(),
leanpub-end-insert
      parts.setupCSS(PATHS.style)
    );
    break;
  default:
    ...
}

module.exports = validate(config);
}
```

If you execute `npm run build` now, you should see better results:

```bash
[webpack-validator] Config is valid.
Hash: aec016ce2e9d0dfa1577
Version: webpack 1.13.0
Time: 3342ms
     Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    app.js      38 kB       0  [emitted]  app
app.js.map     325 kB       0  [emitted]  app
index.html  157 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] ./app/index.js 123 bytes {0} [built]
  [37] ./app/component.js 136 bytes {0} [built]
    + 36 hidden modules
Child html-webpack-plugin for "index.html":
        + 3 hidden modules
```

Given it needs to do more work, it took longer. But on the plus side the build is significantly smaller now.

T> Uglify warnings can help you to understand how it processes the code. Therefore it may be beneficial to have a peek at the full output every once in a while.

T> It is possible to push minification further by enabling variable name mangling. It comes with some extra complexity to worry about, but it may be worth it when you are pushing for minimal size. See [the official documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#uglifyjsplugin) for details.

## UglifyJS Specific Options

[UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) is a powerful tool and it provides advanced options you can consider using if you want to push your build further. One useful option is known as `mangle`. It will reduce local variable names to a minimum, usually a single character. It can also rewrite properties to a more compact format. Given these transformations can break your code, be careful.

Here's how you would enable property mangling through Webpack:

```javascript
new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
  compress: {
    warnings: false
  },
  mangle: {
    // Mangle matching properties
    props: /matching_props/,
    // Don't mangle these
    except: [
      'Array', 'BigInteger', 'Boolean', 'Buffer'
    ]
  }
})
```

You can also enable features, such as dropping logging, through further configuration. `console` statements could be dropped by setting `compress.drop_console: true`. UglifyJS documentation contains more ideas like these.

T> Dropping the `console` statements can be achieved through Babel too by using the [babel-plugin-remove-console](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-remove-console) plugin.

## Conclusion

Even though our build is a little better now, there's still a fair amount of work left. The next simple step is to set an environment variable during the build to allow React to optimize itself. This technique can be used in your own code as well. You might want to skip certain checks in production usage and so on to bring the build size down.
