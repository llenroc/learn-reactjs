# Getting Started

Make sure you are using a recent version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. I recommend using at least the most recent LTS (Long-Term Support) version. Before going further, you should have `node` and `npm` commands available at your terminal.

The completed configuration is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs-demos/webpack-demo). If you are unsure of something, refer there.

T> It is possible to get a more controlled environment by using a solution such as [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [nvm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm). Especially Vagrant comes with a performance penalty as it relies on a virtual machine. Vagrant is particularly useful in a team environment, though, as it gives you a predictable environment to develop against.

W> Particularly older versions (e.g. 0.10) are problematic and require extra work, such as polyfilling `Promise` through `require('es6-promise').polyfill()`. This technique depends on the [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise) package.

## Setting Up the Project

To get a starting point, we should create a directory for our project and set up a *package.json* there. npm uses that to manage project dependencies. Here are the basic commands:

```bash
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y # -y generates *package.json*, skip for more control
```

You can tweak the generated *package.json* manually to make further changes to it. We'll be doing some changes through *npm* tool, but manual tweaks are acceptable. The official documentation explains various [package.json options](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) in more detail.

T> You can set those `npm init` defaults at *~/.npmrc*.

## Installing Webpack

Even though Webpack can be installed globally (`npm i webpack -g`), I recommend maintaining it as a dependency of your project. This will avoid issues as then you will have control over the exact version you are running.

The approach works nicely in **Continuous Integration** (CI) setups as well. A CI system can install your local dependencies, compile your project using them, and then push the result to a server.

To add Webpack to our project, execute

```bash
npm i webpack --save-dev # or just -D if you want to save typing
```

You should see Webpack at your *package.json* `devDependencies` section after this. In addition to installing the package locally below the *node_modules* directory, npm also generates an entry for the executable.

## Executing Webpack

You can display the exact path of the executables using `npm bin`. Most likely it points at *./node_modules/.bin*. Try executing Webpack from there through terminal using `node_modules/.bin/webpack` or a similar command.

After executing, you should see a version, a link to the command line interface guide and a long list of options. We won't be using most of those, but it's good to know that this tool is packed with functionality, if nothing else.

```bash
webpack-demo $ node_modules/.bin/webpack
webpack 1.13.0
Usage: https://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html

Options:
  --help, -h, -?
  --config
  --context
  --entry
...
  --display-cached-assets
  --display-reasons, --verbose, -v

Output filename not configured.
```

T> We can use `--save` and `--save-dev` to separate application and development dependencies. The former will install and write to *package.json* `dependencies` field whereas the latter will write to `devDependencies` instead.

## Directory Structure

As projects with just *package.json* are boring, we should set up something more concrete. To get started, we can implement a little web site that loads some JavaScript which we then build using Webpack. After we progress a bit, we'll end up with a directory structure like this:

- app/
  - index.js
  - component.js
- build/
- package.json
- webpack.config.js

The idea is that we'll transform that *app/* to as a bundle below *build/*. To make this possible, we should set up the assets needed and *webpack.config.js* of course.

## Setting Up Assets

As you never get tired of `Hello world`, we might as well model a variant of that. Set up a component like this:

**app/component.js**

```javascript
module.exports = function () {
  var element = document.createElement('h1');

  element.innerHTML = 'Hello world';

  return element;
};
```

Next, we are going to need an entry point for our application. It will simply `require` our component and render it through the DOM:

**app/index.js**

```javascript
var component = require('./component');

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

## Setting Up Webpack Configuration

We'll need to tell Webpack how to deal with the assets we just set up. For this purpose we'll develop a *webpack.config.js* file. Webpack and its development server will be able to discover this file through convention.

To keep things simple to maintain, we'll be using [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) to generate an *index.html* for our application. *html-webpack-plugin* wires up the generated assets with it. Install it to the project:

```bash
npm i html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

To generate a bundle to our build directory and to set up the plugin we need configuration like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

const PATHS = {
  app: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
  build: path.join(__dirname, 'build')
};

module.exports = {
  // Entry accepts a path or an object of entries.
  // We'll be using the latter form given it's
  // convenient with more complex configurations.
  entry: {
    app: PATHS.app
  },
  output: {
    path: PATHS.build,
    filename: '[name].js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Webpack demo'
    })
  ]
};
```

The `entry` path could be given as a relative one. The [context](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#context) field can be used to configure that lookup. Given plenty of places expect absolute paths, I prefer to use absolute paths everywhere to avoid confusion.

If you execute `node_modules/.bin/webpack`, you should see output:

```bash
Hash: 2a7a7bccea1741de9447
Version: webpack 1.13.0
Time: 813ms
     Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    app.js    1.69 kB       0  [emitted]  app
index.html  157 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] ./app/index.js 80 bytes {0} [built]
   [1] ./app/component.js 136 bytes {0} [built]
Child html-webpack-plugin for "index.html":
        + 3 hidden modules
```

This means you have a build at your output directory at *build/app.js*. You can examine the output through your editor to see what Webpack did there. To see the application running, open the `build/index.html` file directly through a browser. On OS X `open ./build/index.html` works.

T> Another way to serve the contents of the directory through a server, such as *serve* (`npm i serve -g`). In this case, execute `serve` at the output directory and head to `localhost:3000` at your browser. You can configure the port through the `--port` parameter.

T> I like to use `path.join`, but `path.resolve` would be a good alternative. See the [Node.js path API](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) for further details.

T> [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/favicons-webpack-plugin) makes it easy to deal with favicons using Webpack. It is compatible with *html-webpack-plugin*.

## Adding a Build Shortcut

Given executing `node_modules/.bin/webpack` is a little verbose, we should do something about it. npm and *package.json* double as a task runner with some configuration. Adjust it as follows:

**package.json**

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
},
...
```

You can execute these scripts through *npm run*. For instance, in this case we could use *npm run build*. As a result you should get build output as before.

This works because npm adds *node_modules/.bin* temporarily to the path. As a result, rather than having to write `"build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack"`, we can do just `"build": "webpack"`.

T> There are shortcuts like *npm start* and *npm test*. We can run these directly without *npm run* although that will work too.

T> It is possible to execute *npm run* anywhere within the project. It doesn't have to be run in the project root in order to work.

## Conclusion

Even though we've managed to set up a basic Webpack setup, it's not that great yet. Developing against it would be painful. Each time we wanted to check out our application, we would have to build it manually using `npm run build` and then refresh the browser.

That's where Webpack's more advanced features come in. To make room for these features, I will show you how to split your Webpack configuration in the next chapter.
